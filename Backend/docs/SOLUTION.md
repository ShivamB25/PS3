# Price Optimization Solution Analysis

This document explains how the implemented solution addresses each aspect of the price optimization challenge.

## Core Challenge Components

### 1. Price Prediction with Upward Bias

#### Implementation:
```python
# Reward weights in EnvConfig
reward_weights = {
    "sales": 0.4,        # Sales performance
    "price": 0.3,        # Price optimization
    "organic_conversion": 0.15,
    "ad_conversion": 0.15
}

# Exploration bonus for higher prices
exploration_bonus = exploration_bonus_scale * (norm_price - norm_median_price)
```

The solution implements this through:
- 30% reward weight for price optimization
- Explicit exploration bonus for prices above median
- Progressive price exploration mechanism
- Positive reward scaling for higher prices

### 2. Historical Median Escape

#### Implementation:
```python
# In PriceOptimizationEnv
def _calculate_reward(self, price, current_price, next_state, ...):
    # Price reward with normalized values
    price_diff = norm_price - norm_median_price
    price_reward = self.config.reward_weights['price'] * price_diff
    
    # Exploration bonus with normalized values
    exploration_bonus = 0
    if norm_price > norm_median_price:
        exploration_bonus = (
            self.config.exploration_bonus_scale *
            (norm_price - norm_median_price)
        )
```

The solution prevents median stagnation through:
- Positive reward scaling for prices above median
- Exploration bonus mechanism
- Progressive difficulty increase
- Automatic entropy tuning in SAC

### 3. Historical Data Utilization

#### Implementation:
```python
# State space includes:
features = [
    "Product Price",
    "Organic Conversion Percentage",
    "Ad Conversion Percentage",
    "Total Profit",
    "Total Sales",
    "Predicted Sales"
]
# Next state prediction using historical data (within DataPreprocessor)
def _predict_next_state(self, price):
    # Find similar historical prices
    price_diff = np.abs(normalized_historical - normalized_price)
    valid_indices = np.where(price_diff <= max_allowed_diff)[0]

```

The solution leverages historical data through:
- 7-day historical windows for state representation
- Similar price point analysis
- Moving averages for trend capture
- Sales prediction using historical patterns

### 4. Exploration vs Exploitation

#### Implementation:
```python
# SAC implementation with automatic entropy tuning
class SACAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.alpha = 0.2  # Temperature parameter
        self.target_entropy = -action_dim
        
    def train(self):
        # Update temperature parameter alpha
        alpha_loss = -(self.log_alpha * (log_probs + self.target_entropy).detach()).mean()
```

The solution balances exploration/exploitation through:
- SAC algorithm with automatic entropy adjustment
- Progressive exploration mechanism
- Reward scaling for new price points
- Bounded action space for stability

### 5. Reward System

#### Implementation:
```python
# Reward calculation
reward = (
    0.4 * sales_reward +          # Sales performance
    0.3 * price_reward +          # Price optimization
    0.15 * organic_conv_reward +  # Organic conversion
    0.15 * ad_conv_reward +       # Ad conversion
    exploration_bonus -           # Exploration incentive
    sales_drop_penalty           # Risk mitigation
)
```

The solution implements rewards through:
- Multi-component reward function
- Weighted objective balancing
- Conversion rate optimization
- Sales performance tracking

### 6. Sales Prediction Integration

#### Implementation:
```python
# In DataPreprocessor
if 'Predicted Sales' not in df.columns:
    df['Predicted Sales'] = df['Total Sales'].rolling(window=7, min_periods=1).mean()

# In Environment
sales_change = (norm_predicted_sales - norm_current_sales)
sales_reward = self.config.reward_weights['sales'] * sales_change
```

The solution incorporates sales prediction through:
- 7-day rolling average for basic prediction
- Sales change reward component
- Penalty for sales drops
- Validation against predicted sales

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Neural Network Architecture

```python
# Actor Network
class Actor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_dim, 256),
            nn.LayerNorm(256),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.1),
            nn.Linear(256, 256),
            nn.LayerNorm(256),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.1)
        )
```

- Value normalization

### 2. State Space Design

```python
# State components
state = {
    'price_history': last_7_days_prices,
    'sales_history': last_7_days_sales,
    'conversion_rates': [organic, ad],
    'predicted_sales': next_day_prediction
}
```

Features:
- Comprehensive state representation
- Historical context
- Normalized features
- Validation checks

### 3. Action Space Design

```python
# Action space
action_space = spaces.Box(
    low=np.array([-1.0]),
    high=np.array([1.0]),
    dtype=np.float32
)
```

Features:
- Continuous price adjustments
- Normalized range
- Safe scaling mechanism
- Bounded outputs
